# Compatibility

The runtime supports deterministic, non-interactive shell workflows:

- Lists, `&&`, `||`, groups, subshells, functions, loops, conditionals and pipelines.
- Scalar, sparse indexed and associative arrays, namerefs and positional parameters.
- Quoting, ANSI-C quoting, brace/tilde/parameter/arithmetic/command expansion,
  word splitting, pathname expansion and quote removal.
- Redirections, here-documents, here-strings, logical descriptor aliases and
  allocated descriptors. `exec` can preserve descriptors or replace evaluation.
- Control, directory, variable, input and formatting builtins, including `read`,
  `mapfile`, `printf -v`, `source`, `eval`, `command`, `type`, `getopts` and `help`.
- `time`, host-mediated filesystem predicates, per-shell trap registration and EXIT
  handlers. Cancellation and external signals do not deliver traps.

Source and shell values preserve bytes, including invalid UTF-8 values. Text-only
host boundaries validate UTF-8. Only LF terminates a source line; CR is data.
Command substitution removes NUL bytes and trailing LF bytes while retaining status.
File paths use the contained POSIX-style namespace defined by `ShellPath` and
`FilePathLookup`, including their size, control-character and traversal constraints.

The deterministic character profile is UTF-8 with invariant character operations.
Length and substring operations count Unicode scalar values and individual malformed
bytes. Shell-word patterns preserve quoting and match scalars when both operands
are valid UTF-8; a malformed pattern or value selects byte matching, as in GNU's
UTF-8 locale. Removal slices the selected bytes directly and can therefore produce
malformed byte values without passing through a text encoder. Pathname operations
retain their separate text-only host boundary and path component policies.

Pipeline status uses fixed `pipefail`: the rightmost failing stage wins. Scripts
are limited to 4 MiB, with structural syntax/nesting guards and CLR collection-size
checks. The source bound limits parser input; nesting guards protect recursive
syntax handling. They are independent of execution duration. There are no lifetime
word, character, brace, argument-copy or pattern-step quotas. Callers supply
cancellation and a live-memory allowance. Pending here-documents followed by a
pipeline/list operator before the body are not fully supported. Builtins implement
their documented option subsets;
`set` sets positional parameters and supports `-e`/`+e` and
`-o errexit`/`+o errexit`. Errexit stops unhandled failures, including failed
pipelines under the fixed pipefail policy. Tested conditions, logical-list
positions and negation suppress it through nested functions/groups and source/eval.
Command substitution clears errexit by default; parenthesized subshells inherit it.
`$-` and `${-}` expose the supported mutable flags. `set -o`/`set +o` inspect
errexit only; other option changes return an error with a diagnostic.

Regular expression conditions currently use .NET regular expressions rather than
claiming full POSIX ERE compatibility. Each match has a 250 ms backtracking timeout;
refusal follows the conditional expression error path. The host cancellation token
does not interrupt an individual .NET regex call before that timeout.

Out of scope: interactive prompts/history/completion, aliases, background execution,
job/process-group control, OS signal handling, process substitution, `coproc`,
`select`, network redirection devices, `ulimit`, `umask` and shell option toggles
other than errexit.
The runtime does not import process environment variables or startup files.

Arithmetic uses wrapping signed 64-bit values, with decimal, octal, hexadecimal and
explicit base-2-through-64 constants. Stored variable/array values are arithmetic
expressions evaluated against current bindings; they are not re-expanded as shell
source. Active numeric recursion shares the structural nesting guard and observes
cancellation. Completed arithmetic work consumes no execution allowance.

Hosts provide external commands, including any `sh`/`bash` aliases and script-file
launch policy. Command names and filesystem capabilities are never inferred from
the ambient machine. Additional host tools do not expand the language grammar.
